## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects, I really recommend

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## My challenge

My challenge is to build out this notifications page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

I must be able to: 

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
